In arrow\n  function, `this` refers to the enclosing execution context:\n  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Lexical_this.\n  If you wrote the `handleAnswer` function like this (in ES5):\n\n  handleAnswer(answerWasCorrect) {\n    if (answerWasCorrect) {\n      this.setState(currState => ({\n        correctAnswer: currState.correctAnswer + 1\n      }));\n    }\n    this.setState(currState => ({\n      numQuestions: currState.numQuestions + 1\n    }));\n  }\n\n  Then, you'd need to bind `this` in order for the function to refer to the\n  App object, which has the state property on it, as its 'this' value.\n\n  Common Approach 1:\n\n  `<Game handleAnswer={this.handleAnswer} />`\n  would need to be\n  `<Game handleAnswer={this.handleAnswer.bind(this)} />`\n\n Take a look here if you're not sure what the `.bind(this)` does:\n https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38334062/why-do-you-need-to-bind-a-function-in-a-constructor.\n\n This approach doesn't have great performance because using `bind` creates an entirely\n new function\n (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind),\n thereby making the component it's passed to believe that it's being passed a different\n property. In other words, binding inside of a property that's being passed to\n a component (e.g. <Game handleAnswer={this.handleAnswer} />) makes that component\n think that the property it's getting (handleAnswer) has changed. Components\n re-render when the property that's passed to them changes or their state changes,\n so the component can re-render many more times than is actually necessary.
